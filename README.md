# oveview of machine learning 
# Overview of Machine Learning
# Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It involves building algorithms that can identify patterns in data and make decisions or predictions based on that data.

 # Key Concepts
# Supervised Learning: The model learns from labeled data (e.g., regression, classification).

# Unsupervised Learning: The model identifies patterns in unlabeled data (e.g., clustering, dimensionality reduction).

# Reinforcement Learning: The model learns through trial and error by interacting with an environment.
